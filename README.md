# Learning-about-CORS
Inspired by the teaching of Abhishek EH, Coding DEFT

 Having come up against many CORS errors in my react code, I've decided to take a deep dive into 
 CORS
 EXPRESS
 How they work and why.
 
 My findings:
 # CORS
 Cross Origin Resource Sharing
 HTTP based header mechanism
 Traffic cop who is able to communicate between server(over there) and us(over here) which roads can be used for traffic flow. In our case, our localhost:3000.

 The traffic cop also is in charge of making sure only certain resources are shared across different platforms.
 # EXPRESS
